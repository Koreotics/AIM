Artificial Intelligence for Minesweeper

Things to do:
1. With a fixed amount of bombs, we use random number generator to randomise the location (coordinates of each bomb)
2. allow squares to count adjacent bombs
3. Print a string representation of the minesweeper grid
4. Get Timer to work
5. get flag count/bomb count to work

Tristan: 
1. Get Eclipse to work.
